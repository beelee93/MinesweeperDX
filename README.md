Minesweeper using Direct2D

This is more of a fun project for myself to learn how to use Direct2D. From here, 
I'll move on to more features of Direct2D and see what kind of games my imagination
(and aptitude/attitude) can produce.

The source code is partitioned in, hopefully, a very logical manner.
Graphics -> Encapsulates the graphics engine for the game
Logic -> Main game logic (and a little animation too)
MinesweeperDX -> The core of the application. All window processing and drawing calls
                 are done here.
